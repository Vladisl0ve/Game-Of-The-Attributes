		Natural Selection
	There are cells with commands in random order. After some iterations natural selection makes 
a new step in evolution: command's order becomes good enough for prosperity of life.


To do:
1. Code logic for cells (command order)
2. Make a "field for life" (create environment)
3. Develop "Round's rules" (each round - one generation)
